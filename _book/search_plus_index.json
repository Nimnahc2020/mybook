A good CFO could save a company; a bad one might bury it. The covid-19 pandemic presents a different challenge—and highlights the role of another corporate function, often unfairly dismissed as soft. Never have more firms needed a hard-headed HR boss. The duties of chief people officers, as top human-resources executives are sometimes called, are critical. They must keep employees healthy; maintain morale; oversee a historic remote-working experiment; and consider whether, when and how to lay workers off. Their in-trays are bulging. Once derided as “pay and parties” managers, by the early 1990s HR chiefs turned to compliance, keeping firms out of the courts (and newspapers). A subsequent string of corporate imbroglios raised their status, notes Patrick Wright of the University of South Carolina. Executive-pay scandals in the 2000s at firms such as WorldCom and Tyco got them more involved in remuneration. A decade later bungled successions at giants like HP, a printer-maker, left them with a bigger say in filling top jobs. More recently they have dealt with firms’ often very public “me too” troubles. As recruiting and retaining skilled workers became CEOs’ big concern—four fifths now fret about skill shortages, up from half in 2012—HR heads’ desks moved closer to the corner office. Today many reside right next to the boss. Shareholders are inviting more outside HR chiefs onto boards. In America salaries remain lower than CFOs’ pay but have risen about 20% faster since 2010 (see chart). A higher profile entails new expectations. HR was once the domain of history graduates and masters in labour relations; nowadays plenty hold business degrees. Although most firms recruit them from HR jobs, more are choosing outsiders or unconventional candidates. Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive-search firm, found that HR heads appointed to Fortune 100 companies in 2016-19 were around 50% likelier than earlier hires to have worked abroad, in general management or finance. Before covid-19 tight labour markets and millennial empowerment forced employers to think about getting the most out of workers, says Dane Holmes, a former human-capital head at Goldman Sachs who now runs Eskalera, an HR-analytics firm. Diane Gherson, in charge of HR at IBM, overhauled the computing giant’s performance management with big data. Algorithms challenge managers’ instincts on pay and promotion and alert her team when employees are at risk of fleeing (often before they realise it themselves). The pandemic makes such “people analytics” more relevant. Beth Galetti, Ms Gherson’s opposite number at Amazon and an engineer with no prior HR experience, oversees 1,000 developers working exclusively on HR tech. The e-commerce titan’s earlier investment in digital induction for new hires is paying off. “We on-boarded 1,700 new corporate employees on Monday [March 16th] alone,” Ms Galetti reports. Covid-19 may lead more HR chiefs to adopt such systems. Right now most have more pressing problems. Mala Singh, chief people officer at EA, a maker of video games, represents the C-suite in its pandemic-response group. This occupies 60-70% of her (long) day. Her team has been getting desks, computers, even noise cancelling headphones for home-workers. A bigger concern is balancing jobs with child care. Ms Singh told the caregivers on staff to take as much time as they need to adapt without using up paid leave. She is digitally monitoring employee sentiment, particularly anxiety. In a creative business like EA’s, stress about family “does not enable productive work”, she explains. Many companies outside the knowledge economy face tougher choices. HR leaders must strike a balance between a firm’s professed purpose, which these days often involves treating staff well, and the bottom line, observes Dan Kaplan of Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The instinct is to cut costs through mass lay-offs. Rather than slash payrolls willy-nilly, says Bill Schaninger of McKinsey, another consultancy, good HR heads can try to reconfigure company work flows: what needs to be done by whom, what can be automated and what requires people to share the same space. Some workers who at first appear redundant may be redeployed or reskilled. The smartest HR-ers at the doughtiest firms are already gazing beyond the flattened curve. Though not quite recruiting— times are too uncertain—Ms Gherson has begun to groom rivals’ talent. Now that everyone is working from home, she says, no one is listening in on their calls. For an HR chief, “it’s the perfect opportunity.” —— Mar 28th 2020 | Business | 769 words 每日一学 本文第七段第二句话，“Beth Galetti, Ms Gherson’s opposite number at Amazon and…”中的 opposite number 是“对手”吗？ opposite number这个短语中出现了opposite一词，可能会有些同学将其理解为对手，但其实这个短语是表示“职位或地位相当的人”，英文解释如下：a person whose position in another group, organization, or country is equivalent to that held by someone already mentioned. 原文这里就是在说Beth Galetti 是 Mr Gherson 在亚马逊公司中干同一职务的人。 原文链接：请点我 © ruchan all right reserved，powered by Gitbook最后修改于： 2020-04-27 "},"C语言/":{"url":"C语言/","title":"C","keywords":"","body":"C 语言学习笔记 该分区用以记录 C 语言的学习笔记。 © ruchan all right reserved，powered by Gitbook最后修改于： 2020-04-27 "},"C语言/笔记1.html":{"url":"C语言/笔记1.html","title":"学习笔记一","keywords":"","body":"笔记一 为什么要学习C语言：乔布斯，比尔盖茨从小喜欢编程 改变与创造 UNIX C语言 第一个C语言程序：HELLO,WORLD! 每个人都应该学会如何编程，因为它教我们怎么思考 如何学好C语言？ 精讲，多练 计算机科学导论 C程序设计语言 适不适合学习C语言：只要会键盘和鼠标就行 计算机文化基础 ENIAC第一台计算机 计算机之父：冯·诺依曼 冯诺依曼模型： 计算机是二进制（只有0和1，用完要进位：0，1，进位→10，11，进位→100，101，110，111，进位→1000，1001，1010，1011，1100，1101，1110，1111进位→ 八进制 十六进制 计算机只能读懂二进制 由五大部件组成： 计算机是按照存储程序的原理工作的：预先编好程序（一系列指令的有序集合），利用输入设备把程序输入内存，计算机在控制器控制下，从内存中逐条取出程序交运算器执行。把结果回送入内存、或由输出设备输出。 计算机语言（机器语言）→汇编语言（人能看懂，低级语言）→高级语言 C语言-面向过程的高级语言 由于计算机只能读懂计算机语言，人只学习高级语言，这需要翻译：解释（同声翻译） 编译（C语言所用，翻译完再解释） Tiobe编程语言社区 第一节课：让计算机开口说话 任何一个C语言的程序有且仅有一个 main 主函数（function 是为了完成一个功能） 任何一个语句以分号;结尾 对于int main ，C 语言认为一个函数就应该有一个值、有一个结果，会产生随机数（我们无法掌控）而我们只是为了让 main 函数完成一个主功能，不需要垃圾数 我们加入int (integer)代表整数，结尾有return 0，告诉计算机 main 是有数的（整数 0 ），不要产生随机数了。 取 0 因为 C 语言 main 函数规范中，程序运行正确返回 0，否则为非 0 头文件 用\\n换行 注意 : 小写字母 英文输入法 main() 先搭好框架 #include int main() { return 0; } 第二节课：让计算机帮忙做算术 2^10=1024 把计算机存储看为抽屉，一个抽屉里有八个数字（由0，1组成），构成一个字节（Byte） 变量 ：赋值=，给房间取名时赋予一定的意义 变量一定要先声明再使用 输入输出函数库：printf：把双引号里的内容原封不动的输出在屏幕上 scanf：原封不动的把双引号的内容从键盘上给我（输入） &：取地址 设计时考虑用户的体验 提升程序的可读性 让花括号单独一行，相互呼应。 第三节课：让计算机自己做决定 表示自己的算法：流程图 Tips: main 函数有且仅有一个 且函数后有()语法规定 main() English printf函数内容换行一定要注意 不能直接用回车 可用 \\n 可换行用新的printf 用两次双引号 © ruchan all right reserved，powered by Gitbook最后修改于： 2020-04-27 "},"C语言/笔记2.html":{"url":"C语言/笔记2.html","title":"学习笔记二","keywords":"","body":"笔记二 还在梳理中 ing ！！！ © ruchan all right reserved，powered by Gitbook最后修改于： 2020-04-27 "}}
